## Features:
### 1. Sign up/Log in
### 2. Create a listing
This is one of main features for listing owners. Customers could use the feature to upload their spare storage with all necessary information. Moreover, for the sake of attracting storage-seekers, fancy images could be uploaded and managed whenever you like. 

When you are in log-in state, you will be allowed to post your own listing. The post steps are as follows:

1. Click the "Post my storage" in the Homepage or your own listing page.
2. Fill up all required information including name, zip code, price, size, address, city, state.
3. Images upload is optional, but recommended. 
4. Please click on the button - "Location Check" to make sure your address is valid and what you want in a geographic map.
5. Finally press the "Save" button and finish your posting.
### 3. Make a booking
### 4. Edit listing/booking
### 5. Search listing & Map mode
This is an advanced feature from iteration II. As a storage-seeker, you may not know where your target is or you may just know some basic information, like a very ambiguous street name. For this scenario, we developed a fuzzy search feature that support fuzzy matching between user query and listings. Besides, auto-suggestion is also supported and users could see available listing in a map mode at the same time. makes our product more user-friendly. 

\* Microsoft Azure Map supports address-matching RESTful APIs and map component.
